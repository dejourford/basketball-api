<h1>basketball-api</h1>

<h2>PURPOSE</h2>
The purpose of this project is to build a fullstack app that tells the client who the best basketball player on any team is. This app is intended to help reinforce my understanding of express and APIs. 

<h2>HOW TO USE</h2>
Just enter the name of the basketball team and text of their best player will show up!

<h2>LESSONS LEARNED</h2>
--need to learn how to reference index file even if it isn't in the same directory as my server file
<br>
--module_not_found error means that you're not in the same directory as your server
<br>
--you don't need the live server; you can just use the created server to view/edit the page
